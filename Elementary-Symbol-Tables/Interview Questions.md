# Elementary Symbol Tables Interview Questions

## 1. Java autoboxing and equals().
Consider two `double` values `a` and `b` and their corresponding `double` values `x` and `y`.

* Find values such that `(a==b)` is `true` but `x.equals(y)` is `false`.
* Find values such that `(a==b)` is `false` but `x.equals(y)` is `true`.

## 2. Check if a binary tree is a BST.
Given a binary tree where each `Node` contains a key, determine whether it is a binary search tree. Use extra space proportional to the height of the tree.

## 3. Inorder traversal with constant extra space.
Design an algorithm to perform an inorder traversal of a binary search tree using only a constant amount of extra space.

## 4. Web tracking.
Suppose that you are tracking `n` web sites and `m` users and you want to support the following API:

* User visits a website.
* How many times has a given user visited a given site?
